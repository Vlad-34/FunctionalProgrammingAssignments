{-| Compares two intervals.

Intervals are first compared compare by the `start` field.
If the `start` field is equal, the they are compare by the `end` fields:

  - If both are missing (`Nothing`), the intervals are considered equal
  - If both are present (`Just`), the longer interval is considered greater
  - If only one interval is open (its `end` field is `Nothing`) then it will be considered greater

```

{-| Intervals have class interval.
The start date has class interval-start.
The end date has class interval-end. If the end date is missing, the text "Present" is used.
